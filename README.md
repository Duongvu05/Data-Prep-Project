## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the critical importance of data preparation in machine learning through compelling data storytelling. We compare raw data versus carefully prepared data to showcase how proper data preparation dramatically improves insights, visualizations, and model performance.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Data Storytelling**: Create compelling narratives that highlight the difference between raw and processed data
- **Technical Analysis**: Provide detailed analysis of storytelling techniques and visualization principles
- **Practical Implementation**: Demonstrate data preparation impact through real machine learning models

## 📊 Dataset

[Describe your chosen dataset here]
- **Source**: [Dataset source]
- **Size**: [Number of records and features]
- **Domain**: [Application domain - healthcare, finance, retail, etc.]
- **Challenges**: [Data quality issues present in raw data]

## 📊 Data Storytelling Elements

Our storytelling approach follows principles from "Storytelling with Data":

1. **Context**: Setting up the business problem
2. **Conflict**: Highlighting data quality challenges
3. **Resolution**: Demonstrating preparation benefits
4. **Visualization Principles**:
   - Reduced clutter
   - Strategic use of preattentive attributes
   - Appropriate chart selection
   - Clear narrative flow

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Preparation Pipeline
- Data cleaning and validation
- Missing value handling
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Feature engineering and selection
- Data transformation and normalization

### Machine Learning Models
- [List models used for comparison]
- [Hyperparameter optimization]
- [Cross-validation strategy]
